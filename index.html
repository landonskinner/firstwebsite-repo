          Hello! I'm Landon Skinner from Austin, Texas. I recently graduated from
          Villanova University in May 2021 with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering. I've 
          recently completed the Flatiron School's pre-work curriculum for the upcoming
          15-week bootcamp in Software Engineering. My final project for the pre-work section
          is using my new skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design my very own 
          website.
          <br><br>
          My goal for creating this site is to introduce myself both inside and outside
          of a software engineering setting. I hope for you to learn more about who I am,
          and I aim to document my progress throughout my bootcamp experience.
